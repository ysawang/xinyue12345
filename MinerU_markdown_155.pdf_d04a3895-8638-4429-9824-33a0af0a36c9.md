# ABSTRACT

Porous materials filled with shear thickening fluids (STF) can adapt flexibly to complex dynamic loadings environments, showing great promise as an advanced composite material with high impact resistance. However, the energy absorption performance of these STF related materials is not fully exploited due to the low coupling efficiency between the STF and the structure. In this paper, the dynamic compressive behavior of STF filled star-shaped honeycombs (SSH) with significant negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect was studied using modified SHPB experiments and finite element (FE) simulations. The coupling mechanism between the NPR effect and the shear-thickening behavior of STF is analyzed. The dynamic mechanical performance of the STF-filled SSH (SSH-STF) under initial velocity impact and constant velocity compression loading, including stress distribution, energy dissipation, and coupling strength, is comprehensively analyzed. The results indicate that SSH-STF enhances energy absorption efficiency by the mutual extrusion effect of SSH and STF, which limits local deformation and modifies the unstable deformation mode of SSH, while also expanding the energy absorption region. The shear thickening effect of STF limits  $82\%$  of the in-plane rotation behavior of SSH-STF unit cells compared to unfilled SSH under high-velocity impact, promoting uniform and sufficient contraction deformation across the unit cells, which enhances the mean crushing force by  $253\%$ . Meanwhile, the shear thickening behavior of STF leads to faster stress transfer within SSH, significant enhancement of the local deformation stability and effectively increasing the critical impact velocity of the SSH-STF. In this paper, the significant enhancement of energy absorption performance of the STF-SSH composite provides valuable insights for the design of STF-filled auxetic honeycomb structures in practical applications.

# 1. Introduction

Auxetic honeycomb metamaterials have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their lightweight, high specific strength, and flexible design capabilities, which have been widely used in impact protection fields such as automotive and aerospace [1,2]. The auxetic honeycombs can promote overall deformation through compression and contraction, enhancing energy absorption performance compared to traditional honeycombs [3-5]. Although numerous studies have focused on optimizing designs to improve energy absorption [6-10], the plastic

hinge mechanism and high porosity of the auxetic honeycomb structures have seemingly led to a bottleneck in further enhancement [10,11].

Stiffness and energy absorption capacity of auxetic honeycomb structures can be enhanced by filling different kinds of materials [12-17]. Generally, filling with soft materials such as polyurethane foam, which undergo densification earlier during compression, can delay the buckling of cell walls of auxetic honeycomb, effectively increasing its resistance to localized impact [10,18]. In addition, the failure mode transition of auxetic honeycombs filled with soft materials from interlayer failure to localized shear band failure can increase the

energy-absorbing region of the structure [14]. In contrast, filling auxetic honeycombs with rigid materials increases the stiffness. The extrusion and friction interactions during compression provide superior energy absorption performance [15,16]. It can be seen that the filling of soft materials primarily optimizes the deformation mode of auxetic honeycomb structures, and the energy absorption still dominated by the plastic deformation of the honeycomb itself, which limits the energy absorption capacity [12,19]. The harder fillers can increase energy absorption by increasing stiffness during compression. However, the overall deformation is generally restrained due to the localized failure under initial impact loading in honeycombs [13,16,20]. Therefore, some intelligent filler materials, which can rapidly enhance the overall deformation response during the initial stage of impact loads and then increase the structural stiffness during continued deformation, are required for auxetic honeycomb structures to enhance the energy absorption capacity.

Shear thickening (ST) [21-23] materials that show transition from soft to rigid under loading are primarily classified into shear thickening fluids (STF) [24-28] and shear thickening gels (STG) [29-31]. STGs are widely applied in personal protective materials due to their excellent energy dissipation and sealing advantages. [32,33]. Liao et al. [32] developed a novel hybrid auxetic foam by filling auxetic polyurethane foam (APF) with STG, demonstrating significant impact force attenuation along with notable self-healing capabilities. Sun et al. [34,35] explored the impact resistance of honeycombs filled with STG and observed that STG reduced significantly the structural penetration depth and impact damage severity. Furthermore, Li et al. [29,36] demonstrated that partial filling of zero Poisson's ratio metamaterials with STG enhanced energy absorption efficiency by  $85\%$  under low-velocity impacts. Notably, the study by Gong et al. [37,38] showed that shear stiffening gel (SSG) transforms from a plastic to a rubbery state and then to a glassy state under loading, demonstrating application potential similar to STG in personal protection. By integrating SSG with Kevlar, Gong et al. [39] developed successfully multifunctional body armor with a  $353\%$  improvement in impact force attenuation. Wu et al. [40-42] revealed that the NPR effect enhances significantly the coupling behavior between the NPR skeleton and SSG, increasing the energy absorption rate (EAR) by  $76.3\%$  under low-velocity impact.

Notably, the viscosity of STF increases significantly at the critical shear strain, enabling its effective application in impact protection engineering [43-48]. Wu et al. [49,50] fabricated successfully STF microcapsules with significant shock attenuation capability. Lu et al. [51, 52] observed that the STF composite structure reduces the peak load by up to  $154.7\%$  under low-velocity impact by dispersing the impact stress and creating low-stress regions. Hu et al. [53-55] elucidated the energy absorption mechanism of traditional honeycombs coupled with STF and observed that SEA decreased due to the compression-expansion behavior, which was improved by using auxetic lattice structures. However, the coupling mechanisms between auxetic honeycombs and STF under different critical impact velocity remain unclear.

In this paper, star-shaped honeycombs (SSH), which show significant NPR effect and stable deformation mode under dynamic impact loading [56-59], are chosen to explore the energy absorption potential of STF-filled SSH structures. Through modified SHPB experiments, we demonstrate the enhanced energy absorption performance of SSH-STF, while numerical simulations systematically reveal its energy enhancing coupling mechanism. SSH-STF demonstrates intelligent adaptation to loading rates and enhances energy absorption efficiency, while the coupling mechanism between STF and SSH reveals that the NPR effect and the shear thickening interaction work together to improve the overall structural response and energy absorption capacity under dynamic impact. The paper provides a new strategy for designing lightweight structures with excellent dynamic energy absorption performance in impact protection applications, such as the anti-collision structures employed in vehicles. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the SHPB testing and finite element (FE) methods

and tests the mechanical properties of SSH and STF. Section 3 compares and validates the superior deformation mode and energy absorption behavior of SSH-STF over SSH under dynamic impact. Section 4 demonstrates the coupling mechanism between STF and SSH through shear strain rate maps, unit cell deformation, and stress transfer analysis at dynamic impact loading.

# 2. Materials and methods

# 2.1. Manufacturing of SSH structure

The SSH structure used in this study is shown in Fig. 1(a), manufactured from 6061-T6 aluminum alloy using 3D printing technology. The overall height  $(H)$  and width  $(L)$  of the SSH are both  $50\mathrm{mm}$ , with the out-of-plane thickness of the cell  $(B)$  being  $40\mathrm{mm}$ , and the structure is composed of a  $5\times 5$  grid of star-shaped cells. The geometry of the typical star-shaped cell, highlighted in the red dashed box, is shown in Fig. 1(b). The length of the horizontal and vertical ribs,  $L_{a}$  connecting to the other cells are  $3.4\mathrm{mm}$ . The length of the inclined wall of the star-shaped cell,  $L_{b}$ , is  $4.3\mathrm{mm}$ . The wall angle of the cell,  $\theta$ , is  $30^{\circ}$ . Noteworthy, the structure is designed with additional upper and lower plates, which can better restore the actual application of working conditions and better filling fluid.

# 2.2. Mechanical properties of 6061-T6 and SSH under quasi-static loading

The schematic diagram of the tensile experiments (Exp) and the results for the matrix material, 6061-T6 aluminum alloy, used in the 3D printing of SSH structures are shown in Fig. 2. The tensile specimens were designed and fabricated according to ASTM E8M standards, with the consistent thickness of  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  from the SSH structure. The total length, parallel length, width of the tensile specimens are  $200\mathrm{mm}$ ,  $100\mathrm{mm}$  and  $12.5\mathrm{mm}$ , respectively. All test specimens were stretched at the loading velocity of  $1\mathrm{mm / min}$ , and the extensometer is used to accurately measure strain. The main purpose of the uniaxial tensile test on 6061-T6, which was to obtain data for FE simulation and parametric analysis for SSH structures.

The SSH structure was tested to quasi-static compression testing using universal testing machine, with the compression velocity set at  $2\mathrm{mm / min}$ . We established the FE model of SSH under the same working conditions as the quasi-static compression experiments, using the FE method similarly to other studies [10,56]. For the 6061-T6 aluminum alloy, its density  $\rho_{\mathrm{a}} = 2700\mathrm{kg / m^3}$ , Young's modulus  $E_0 = 69\mathrm{GPa}$ , Yield strength  $\sigma_{\mathrm{y}} = 267\mathrm{MPa}$ , and Poisson's ratio  $\nu_{0} = 0.33$ . Meanwhile, the simulation results with the mesh sizes of  $0.08\mathrm{mm}$ ,  $0.1\mathrm{mm}$ , and  $0.12\mathrm{mm}$  were compared to verify the mesh convergence of the model. As shown in Fig. 3 (a), the simulated stress-strain response of the SSH structure using a mesh size of  $0.1\mathrm{mm}$  agrees well with the experimental results. In addition, the simulated deformation behaviors of the SSH at strains of  $\varepsilon = 0.3$  and  $\varepsilon = 0.6$  are consistent with the experimental results, as shown in Fig. 3 (b). Numerical results also revealed the significant NPR effect of SSH under quasi-static loading, with the peak Poisson's ratio of  $-0.44$ .

# 2.3. Material properties of STF

STF with particle mass fraction of  $68\%$  was prepared by mixing  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$  nanoparticles with proper amount of PEG-200, with the density  $\rho_{\mathrm{s}} = 1640\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$ . The specific fabrication process of STF was outlined in previously published study [60,61]. In addition, PEG-filled SSH (SSH-PEG) was selected as a constant viscosity fluid to further validate the unique coupling mechanism of SSH-STF, with the density of  $1130\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$  and the viscosity of  $0.052\mathrm{Pa}\cdot \mathrm{s}$  [62]. Nanoparticle characterization was conducted using Zeiss Ultra 55 (Zeiss, Germany)

field-emission scanning electron microscope. The rheological analysis of STF was performed with Kinexus Pro rotary rheometer (Malvern, UK) at  $25^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , using a  $40~\mathrm{mm}$  diameter cone with the  $1^{\circ}$  angle and the gap of  $0.03\mathrm{mm}$ . The results are shown in Fig. 4, SiO2 nanoparticles are nearly

monodisperse, with the average diameter of  $200\mathrm{nm}$ . Similar to other non-Newtonian fluids, STF shows shear thinning at lower shear rates, whereas rapid shear thickening behavior occurs when the shear strain rate exceeds the critical value of  $27~s^{-1}$ .

In addition, the relationship between the shear viscosity of  $\eta (\dot{\gamma})$  and shear strain rate of  $\dot{\gamma}$  for the  $68\%$  STF was further fitted using the power-law model, expressed as  $\eta (\dot{\gamma}) = m\dot{\gamma}^{n - 1}$ , where  $m$  and  $n$  are material constants. Through testing data fitting in the shear-thinning phase, the constants were determined as  $m = 16$  and  $n = 0.47$  at the shear thinning stage. Generally, the viscosity of STF with continuous shear thickening behavior will drops again when the shear rate is very high, and the viscosity of STF with discontinuous shear thickening behavior would increase with increasing shear rate, followed by yield and even crack initiation and propagation as a solid at very high shear rate. In this paper, STF with discontinuous shear thickening behavior is employed. As it is difficult to obtain the dynamic behavior of the STF in the shear thickening regime, we assume that the viscosity of the STF increases with increasing shear rate based on our previous study [62]. With this method, the simulation results agree well with the experimental results.

# 2.4. Fabrication of SSH-STF and modified SHPB testing methods

The balloon with a thickness of  $0.02\mathrm{mm}$  is used to effectively seal STF within SSH. It has negligible influence on the mechanical properties of the SSH-STF and can therefore be treated as a free boundary condition, as the elastic modulus of the balloon is only  $0.5\mathrm{MPa}$  [61].

shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), a 5-inch balloon is appropriately cut and stretched to accommodate exactly the SSH structure. The fluid is then injected slowly through a syringe until the structure is fully filled, as shown in Fig. 5(c).

Fig. 6 shows the experimental setup of the modified SHPB testing for SSH-STF and the corresponding schematic diagram. The prepared SSH-STF, shown in Fig. 6(a), is secured to a transmitted bar measuring  $\Phi 80 \times 4000\mathrm{mm}$  with transparent tape for the modified SHPB test setup. The transmitted bar is made of 7075 aluminum alloy with a yield stress of  $510\mathrm{MPa}$ , which can be regarded as a rigid support compared to 6061-T6 and is supported by Teflon holders. A hollow cylindrical iron mass block, weighing  $1\mathrm{kg}$  with dimensions of  $\Phi 80 \times 100\mathrm{mm}$ , was used to impact the SSH. The mass block was launched and velocity-controlled using an acrylic round tube of the same diameter, which connected to the gas gun. In addition, high-velocity photography was employed to capture the velocity and displacement of the mass block during testing, while strain gauges attached to the strain gages on the transmitted bar were used to calculate the force-displacement curve during dynamic loading.

In the modified SHPB test, high-pressure gas is used to accelerate the mass block, which impacts the SSH-STF specimen at a pre-determined velocity. The impact generates an elastic compressive wave, which propagates into the transmitted bar with a strain distribution denoted as  $\varepsilon(t)$ . Based on the one-dimensional elastic wave propagation equation, the compression process, which is considered to be in equilibrium, will be verified in subsequent results, and then the engineering stress  $\sigma$  can

be calculated as

$$
\sigma = E \frac {A _ {0}}{A _ {S}} \varepsilon (t). \tag {1}
$$

Where  $A_0$  and  $A_S$  are cross-section areas of the specimen and the transmitted bar, respectively,  $E$  is the modulus of elasticity of the transmitted bar.

The compression displacement of the mass block  $(\delta_{1})$  is captured using high-velocity photography, while the displacement of the transmitted bar face is relatively small. Based on the relationship between the stress wave and impact velocity,  $\varepsilon (t) = \rho_0c_0\nu_{st}$ , and  $c_{0} = \sqrt{E / \rho_{0}}$ , where  $\rho_0$  and  $c_{0}$  are density and longitudinal wave velocity in the incident bar,  $\nu_{st}$  is the velocity of the transmitted bar face. Then we can obtain the displacement of the transmitted bar face

$$
\delta_ {0} = 2 / c _ {0} \int_ {0} ^ {t} \varepsilon (t). \tag {2}
$$

The relative displacement of the SSH-STF impact surface can be expressed as  $\delta = \delta_{1} - \delta_{0}$ .

# 2.5. Numerical model

The FE model by ANSYS LS-DYNA was created to represent the SSH-STF specimen, with a rigid bottom plate and a cylindrical rigid upper plate, as shown in Fig. 7. The rigid cylinder retained freedom only in the compression direction (Y-direction). As the impedance of the transmitted bar is about 62 times that of SSH (see Appendix A), it was simplified to a rigid plate with all degrees of freedom fixed. Notably, the balloon was neglected when establishing the numerical model, as gravity was not considered in the model. Whereas Lagrangian hexahedral solid elements were used for both the upper and lower rigid bodies, while the SSH structure was modeled with Belytschko-Tsay shell elements. The friction coefficient of 0.2 was applied for the solid mesh contact settings, and the *CONTACT_AUTOMATIC SURFACE TO SURFACE method was used for defining the contact algorithm. ALE mesh can effectively simulate the fluid characteristics of STF, water and air, with the mesh size of 0.8 times that of the Lagrangian elements in the SSH to avoid fluid penetration [63,64]. SSH-STF is simulated using the coupled Lagrange-Euler method. Coupling between the fluid and structure is achieved using the *CONSTRAINED_LAGRANGE IN SOLID method. Each Lagrangian element is coupled at three points to ALE mesh to ensure accurate interaction. In addition, to ensure the continuity of displacement, velocity, and acceleration at the fluid-solid interface, shared nodes are used at the boundary between the STF and air.

The basic mechanical properties of 6061-T6 were obtained from tensile experiments and are modeled using the *MAT_024 model in LSDYNA, which simulates elastic-perfectly plastic behavior. The strain-

rate sensitivity coefficients, C and P, were determined based on previous research [65]. The rheological properties of STF were modeled using the *MAT_ALE_VISCOUS* material model, with detailed parameters for STF, water, and air, as well as their equations of state (EOS), as presented in our prior work [45]. Notably, the FE model of the SSH-STF was validated by the results of the SHPB experiment, as shown in Figs. 8-10.

# 3. Results and discussions

# 3.1. SHPB test analysis for SSH and SSH-STF

# 3.1.1. Deformation model of SSH and SSH-STF

Fig. 8 shows the modified SHPB experimental deformation processes for the SSH and SSH-STF at impact velocity of  $20~\mathrm{m / s}$ , with strains of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2, where strain is defined as  $\delta / H$ . The deformation modes of SSH and SSH-STF are significantly different, with SSH-STF demonstrating uniform and stable compression, while SSH shows noticeable cell sliding. For further details, the deformation process of SSH and SSH-STF can be found in supplementary material of Videos 1 and 2.

With the increasing strain from 0.05 to 0.2, SSH consistently exhibits an uneven deformation mode during compression, while the in-plane sliding behavior, occurring layer by layer, is primarily governed by the third-layer unit, as shown in Fig. 8(a). In contrast, SSH-STF consistently maintains uniform compression deformation mode. As the cells undergo contraction, the STF is squeezing out, resulting in shear thickening effect. This process leads to the aggregation of nanoparticles in STF under dynamic compression, forming particle clusters [66]. Consequently, there is a change in the optical properties of STF, resulting in the whitening effect, as shown in Fig. 8(b). Furthermore, by using the bottom plates of the SSH structure as representative contact surfaces for evaluating the coupling with STF, we do not observe the fluid leakage or grid penetration, implying that the fluid and the structure remain effectively coupled (see Appendix B). Comparison of the compression velocity attenuation shows that SSH has velocities of  $19.3\mathrm{m / s}$ ,  $17.6\mathrm{m / s}$ , and  $12.6\mathrm{m / s}$  at strains of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively, while the corresponding velocities for SSH-STF are  $18.6\mathrm{m / s}$ ,  $11.2\mathrm{m / s}$ ,

Meanwhile, SSH filled with water (SSH-Wt) was represented as Newtonian fluid, in contrast to the behavior of STF, as shown in Fig. 9, with the detailed deformation process available in Supplementary material of Video 3. The deformation process of SSH-Wt is similar to that of SSH, indicating no significant improvement in energy dissipation performance compared to SSH. The attenuation process of compression velocities of  $17.4\mathrm{m / s}$ ,  $15.4\mathrm{m / s}$ , and  $11.4\mathrm{m / s}$  at strains of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2, respectively, shows only slight differences compared to SSH. The NPR effects of SSH and SSH-Wt also show similar results, with NPR peaks of  $-0.42$  and  $-0.44$ , respectively, while the NPR peak of SSH-STF

# 3.1.2. Analysis of mechanical response results for SSH and SSH-STF

The histories of compression displacement and reaction force of SSH, SSH-Wt, and SSH-STF from the SHPB tests are shown in Fig. 10. In contrast to SSH and SSH-Wt, SSH-STF shows significantly energy absorption characteristics with smaller compression displacement and higher peak force. Notably, the FE model accuracy is verified, as the FE results exhibit trends consistent with the SHPB experimental data, with errors less than  $5\%$ . Figs. 8 and 9 further show the consistency between the experimental and FE deformation processes. The stress equilibrium is also validated by the consistency between the reaction force at the

bottom surface and deformation process from the FE model and the experimental results.

Fig. 10(a)-(c) show the comparison of the time-displacement and time-reaction force curves for SSH, SSH-Wt, and SSH-STF, respectively. The compression displacement of SSH increases almost linearly over time, while the reaction force shows significant fluctuations due to structural sliding and instability (Fig. 8(a)). Notably, filling the SSH with water enhances its initial stiffness, as demonstrated by the higher initial peak force of SSH-Wt in Fig. 10(b) compared to SSH in Fig. 10(a). However, as compression continues, the reaction force rapidly declines and eventually levels off with SSH. This indicates that water contributes little to energy absorption during sustained compression, resulting in the

time-displacement curve similar to SSH. In contrast, SSH-STF demonstrates significant structural stiffness and energy absorption efficiency, with the force rapidly rising to a peak of  $24\mathrm{kN}$ , which is 2.4 times that of SSH, followed by a rapid decline. The results can be explained by the deformation pattern and stress distribution shown in the FE results in Fig. 8(b). The stress distribution in SSH-STF reaches its peak at 0.1 strain but drops significantly by 0.2 strain. While the stress distribution in SSH continues to increase steadily throughout the compression process. This indicates that the SSH-STF dissipates energy through the overall structural response during compression from 0.05 to 0.1 strain, whereas at 0.2 strain, the structure almost completely absorbs and dissipates energy.

# 3.2. Dynamic mechanical response of SSH filled with different fluids

To comprehensively explore the energy absorption enhancement mechanisms resulting from the coupling of the NPR-effect SSH structure with STF, conducting systematic numerical analysis of dynamic constant-velocity  $V_{\mathrm{c}}$  compression is essential. The selection of velocities for the dynamic compression numerical analysis was based on the critical velocities of the honeycomb structure, which are determined by its deformation mode [67]. The first critical velocity, at which the transition from global to localized deformation occurs, is based on the 'wave trapping' theory proposed by Honig [68] and can be defined as

$$
\nu_ {c r 1} = \int_ {0} ^ {\varepsilon_ {c r}} \sqrt {\sigma^ {\prime} (\varepsilon) \cdot \frac {1}{\rho_ {\mathrm {a}}}} d \varepsilon , \tag {3}
$$

where  $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{cr}}$  is the critical strain at the tangent modulus of the stress-strain curve becomes null, and the  $\sigma^{\prime}(\varepsilon) = \sigma_{\mathrm{y}} / \varepsilon_{\mathrm{cr}}$  is the elastic modulus of the

cellular material.

As the impact velocity increases, the honeycomb structures transition from localized deformation to progressive layer-by-layer collapse, the phenomenon defined by the second critical velocity. The second critical velocity is derived using the "steady wave" theory [69] and be expressed as

$$
v _ {c r 2} = \sqrt {2 \sigma_ {\mathrm {y}} \varepsilon_ {d} \cdot \frac {1}{\rho_ {\mathrm {a}}}}, \tag {4}
$$

where  $\varepsilon_{d}$  is densification strain [70]. From Eqs. (3) and (4), the first and second critical velocities  $(V_{c})$  are determined to be  $5\mathrm{m / s}$  and  $20\mathrm{m / s}$  for the SSH. The velocity of  $50~\mathrm{m / s}$  chosen as a high-velocity impact to clearly contrast localized deformation with layer-by-layer collapse. Moreover, the loading time  $(T)$  can be obtained by dividing the compressive displacement  $(\delta_c)$  by the constant velocity  $(V_{c}), T = \delta_{c} / V_{c}$ .

Therefore, the parameter Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) and the Mean Crushing Force (MCF) were used for analysis to quantitatively compare SSH and SSH-STF with different masses [71]. The SEA is the integral of the compressive displacement and reaction force  $(F)$ , divided by the mass of the structure,  $m_0$ , as

$$
S E A = \frac {\int_ {0} ^ {\delta} F (\delta) d \delta}{m _ {0}}. \tag {5}
$$

MFC can be expressed as

$$
M C F = \frac {\int_ {0} ^ {\delta_ {\mathrm {d}}} F (\delta) d \delta}{\delta_ {\mathrm {d}}}, \tag {6}
$$

where  $\delta_{\mathrm{d}}$  is the densification phase displacement.

# 3.2.1. Energy absorption behaviors of SSH and SSH-STF

Fig. 11 shows the upper surface reaction force, SEA, and MCF of SSH and SSH-STF under dynamic compression velocities. SSH-STF consistently exhibits the highest force and MCF, with its advantage becoming more pronounced as the compression velocity increases, except in the compression displacement range of  $0.1 - 0.2\mathrm{cm}$ , where the force is lower than SSH (see Appendix C for the reason for the higher force in SSH than in SSH-STF). However, the SEA of SSH-STF remains lower than that of SSH at  $5\mathrm{m / s}$  as shown in Fig. 11(a). As the velocity rises to the second critical velocity, the SEA of SSH-STF surpasses that of SSH, with a more pronounced contrast between the two observed at  $50~\mathrm{m / s}$ , as shown in Fig. 11(b) and (c). In addition, comparing the increasing trends of SEA during the densification phase, it can be observed that SSH-STF's SEA rises more slowly than SSH.

The influence of velocity on MCF and SEA for SSH and SSH-STF during the densification phase is more clearly compared in Fig. 11(d). SSH-STF consistently outperforms SSH in terms of MCF, even with  $253.7\%$  higher at  $50~\mathrm{m / s}$ . Compared to the slower increase in SEA for SSH, the SEA of SSH-STF increases linearly with the rising compression velocities.

# 3.2.2. Deformation characteristics with SSH and SSH-STF

The deformations mode and stress distribution of SSH and SSH-STF during the densification phase are shown in Fig. 12. As compression velocity increases, SSH-STF shows more uniform and regular deformation pattern, with higher level and more uniform stress distribution than SSH.

The SSH and SSH-STF show similar deformation modes at  $5\mathrm{m / s}$ . However, as the velocity increases, SSH undergoes disordered densification due to irregular cell stacking, whereas SSH-STF shows more regular deformation pattern. Particularly at  $50~\mathrm{m / s}$ , the deformation of individual cells becomes nearly uniform and fully contracted, demonstrating enhanced structural stability and high responsiveness under high-velocity impacts.

# 3.2.3. Energy absorption behaviors of SSH filling Newtonians fluids

To further validate the distinct coupling mechanism of STF, we

compared SSH filled with water and PEG with STF at  $50~\mathrm{m / s}$ , as shown in Fig. 13. The results demonstrate that the peak forces of SSH-Wt and SSH-PEG increases slightly due to the inertial effect of the filled Newtonians fluids. However, the SEAs of SSH-Wt and SSH-PEG decreases largely due to the weak fluid-solid interaction. In contrast, the strong interaction between SSH and STF after occurrence of shear thickening of STF results in a significant platform force and SEA, approximately 2.2 times and 1.4 times higher than that of SSH-PEG and SSH-Wt, respectively.

# 3.3. Coupling mechanism of SSH-STF

Filling STF into SSH significantly enhances its energy absorption and deformation stability. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, this section analyzes the coupling behavior between SSH and SSH-STF.

# 3.3.1. Shear thickening effect of STF under dynamic loading

Fig. 14 shows the distribution of shear strain rate in SSH-STF at the strain of 0.1 and compression velocities of  $5\mathrm{m / s}$ ,  $20\mathrm{m / s}$ , and  $50\mathrm{m / s}$ . As the velocity increases, the shear strain rate shows significant sensitivity.

At the compression velocity of  $5\mathrm{m / s}$ , the overall shear strain rate distribution of STF is slight, with the peak shear strain rate being only about  $20~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ , which is lower than the shear thickness threshold of  $27~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ . Thus, the STF filling does not have a significant effect on the SSH structure. This demonstrates that the SEA curve of SSH-STF is lower than SSH at  $5\mathrm{m / s}$  (Fig. 11(a)).

As the compression velocity increases to  $20\mathrm{m / s}$ , the shear strain rate increases significantly, with the primary concentration occurring in the unit cells of the SSH structure. The highest shear strain rates are observed at the center of the unit cells and the outer edges of the cell walls, with the overall strain rate reaching  $200~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ .

The shear strain rate distribution exhibits extremely high levels, with a distinct and regular pattern at  $50\mathrm{m / s}$ . All the unit cells of SSH display similar deformation models. High shear strain rate regions are located both within the unit cells and around the wall corners, where the shear strain rate in STF reaches about  $1600\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ . In contrast, shear strain rate in STF near the horizontal connecting walls between the unit cells is

relatively lower, at about  $200\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ . With the significant shear thickness effect of STF in the SSH structure, the SSH-STF demonstrates superior energy absorption efficiency compared to SSH (Fig. 11(c)).

Meanwhile, we obtained the strain rate distributions of SSH-STF, as shown in Fig. 15. With the increase of impact velocity, the strain rate of the SSH structure increases from approximately  $5\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  at  $5\mathrm{m / s}$  to about  $100\mathrm{s}^{-1}$  at  $50~\mathrm{m / s}$ . Notably, SSH filled with STF exhibits more uniform strain rate distribution at  $50~\mathrm{m / s}$  compared to  $5\mathrm{m / s}$  and  $20~\mathrm{m / s}$ . This indicates that the shear thickening effect of STF significantly enhances the overall stability and mechanical response of SSH under higher impact velocity.

The strain rate distribution of SSH filled with Newtonian fluids under high-velocity impact further manifests the unique role of STF. As shown in Fig. 16, compared to SSH-STF the non-uniform distribution of strain rate for SSH, SSH-Wt, and SSH-PEG at  $50~\mathrm{m / s}$  at the strain of 0.1 indicates the layer-by-layer collapse dominated deformation pattern, showing that the Newtonian fluids have slight effects on the deformation pattern of SSH under high-velocity impact.

typical unit cell at  $50~\mathrm{m / s}$ , as shown in Fig. 17. With strains from 0.05 to 0.3, the unit cell of SSH-STF shows higher stress levels and more stable compression deformation process compared to SSH.

Fig. 17(a) shows that the unit cell of SSH undergoes in-plane contraction and rotational deformation process. The stress distribution concentration mainly occurs at the locations where several plastic hinges form, similarly to other research [59,72]. By measuring the rotational angle of the unit cell's side walls, as depicted by the black dotted lines, the relative rotation of  $45^{\circ}$  is observed during the strains from 0.05 to 0.3. Meanwhile, the horizontal ribs experience a relative rotation of  $12^{\circ}$ , which contributes to a certain level of contraction behavior in the horizontal direction of the unit cell.

With the coupling of STF, rotational deformation resistance is demonstrated in SSH-STF, as shown in Fig. 17(b). The relative rotation of the unit cell's side walls is  $8^{\circ}$ , while the horizontal ribs experience almost disappears. This indicates that the shear thickening effect of STF significantly constrains in-plane rotational behavior in SSH-STF and the high stress distribution on the cell walls supports this observation.

Moreover, the in-plane contraction of the unit cell interacts with the compression of the STF under the constraint of rotational restraint, leading to a greater involvement of the unit cell in in-plane contraction, increasing the stress levels on the cell walls. As shown in Fig. 17(b), at the strain of 0.3, the unit cell of SSH-STF almost fully contracts, compressing STF and generating higher stress levels. This compression

results in significant stress distribution along the inner walls of the unit cell. In contrast, Fig. 17(a) shows that at the same strain, the in-plane rotation of SSH hinders contraction, creating space within the unit cell that reduces energy absorption.

Based on the above analysis, we reveal the coupling mechanism between STF and SSH, as shown in Fig. 18. Under dynamic compression, the SSH without STF unit cell exhibits in-plane rotation and contraction, leading to a significant NPR effect. After filling STF, the in-plane rotation of SSH results in the shear thickening effect of STF, which generates a reactive force that resists the in-plane rotation of the SSH unit cell, resulting in more uniform and complete in-plane contraction and significantly improving structural deformation stability. In addition, the squeezing force due to the interaction between the contraction of the SSH unit cell and the shear thickening of STF not only improves the energy dissipation efficiency of STF but also expands the deformation and energy absorption regions of SSH. As a result, the overall deformation and stress distribution of the SSH-STF become more uniform, enhancing the energy absorption of the composite.

# 3.3.3. Improvement of the overall structural response of SSH-STF

Fig. 19 shows the deformation process and stress distribution of SSH and SSH-STF during the compression period from 0 to  $32~\mu \mathrm{s}$  at the compression velocity of  $50~\mathrm{m / s}$ . The SSH-STF demonstrates more uniform deformation and accelerated stress transmission compared to SSH.

Fig. 19. Deformation process and stress distribution of (a) SSH and (b) SSH-STF under compression.


Fig. 19(a) shows that from 0 to  $32~\mu \mathrm{s}$ , the stress transmission and deformation mode of SSH are primarily concentrated in the first layer of unit cells, displaying a clear layer-by-layer collapse. In contrast, the SSH-STF demonstrates a more uniform overall deformation, as shown in Fig. 19(b), with stress transfer occurring more rapidly. At  $5~\mu \mathrm{s}$ , the stress fully propagates through the first layer, showing higher and more evenly distributed stress levels compared to SSH. As compression continues to  $18~\mu \mathrm{s}$ , the stress in SSH-STF has nearly reached the bottom layer. The cell walls and vertical ribs are restricted by the shear thickening STF, which interacts to generate higher stress levels. At  $32~\mu \mathrm{s}$ , the stress was fully transferred to the bottom layer, while the unit cells undergo a slight in-plane contraction, with uniform stress concentration along the inner

walls of the cells due to the overall compression to the STF.

It demonstrates that the complex in-plane structure of SSH impedes the rapid transmission of stress, causing layer-by-layer collapse due to inertial effects under high-velocity impact. In contrast, stress is transmitted more quickly in STF [60,73], and its coupling with the SSH structure enhances overall stress distribution by facilitating rapid stress transfer within the SSH-STF. Moreover, the local shear thickening behavior of the STF limits layer-by-layer collapse, which significantly improves the local deformation stability of the SSH-STF and promotes stress equilibrium under high-velocity impact, resulting in higher critical impact velocity.

# 4. Conclusions

In this paper, the coupling mechanisms between STF and SSH under impact is studied. The main conclusions are as follows.

1. A new design approach for STF-filled SSH auxetic honeycomb structures is proposed, significantly enhancing energy absorption and structural stability under dynamic impacts. After filling STF, the MCF of SSH increases by  $253\%$ , and the SEA improves by  $54\%$ .

2. The coupling mechanism between the shear thickening effect of STF and the NPR effect of SSH is revealed, showing that the NPR effect drives a higher shear strain rate in STF due to the in-plane contraction and rotation of the SSH structure. This enhances the shear thickening effect, leading to more effective energy dissipation and improved coupling between STF and SSH.

3. The shear thickening effect of STF suppresses approximately  $82\%$  of the in-plane rotational behavior of the SSH structure, leaving only contraction deformation. This significantly enhances the stability of the SSH structure, allowing it to fully contract and absorb energy more effectively.

4. The coupling of shear thickening in STF and compressive deformation in SSH accelerates the propagation of stress waves within the SSH structure, thereby increasing the critical impact velocity and improving the structure's performance under high-velocity impacts.

5. SSH-STF exhibits a more uniform and stable overall response under higher velocity impacts, which has not been addressed in existing research.
