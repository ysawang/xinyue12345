# ABSTRACT

Reasonably applying hierarchical or hybrid methods in the design of advanced metamaterials can effectively enhance their energy absorption performance. To achieve a honeycomb metamaterial with enhanced energy absorption capacity, a novel bio-inspired locally enhanced re-entrant honeycomb (LERH) is proposed by integrating parallelogram and triangular structures into the re-entrant honeycomb (RH), based on both hierarchical and hybrid methods. Through quasi-static compression experiments, the energy absorption characteristic of the LERH is studied thoroughly, and the accuracy of the numerical model is verified to ensure its reliability in predicting the crushing behavior of the LERH. Notably, the stress-strain curve of the LERH exhibits two plateau stages, and the second plateau stress is  $242.59\%$  higher than the first. Furthermore, the crushing responses under different crushing velocities are investigated, and the theoretical analysis of plateau stress is carried out. Compared with other auxetic honeycombs, the LERH exhibits a superior energy absorption capacity. Specifically, its specific energy absorption is  $155.3\%$  higher than that of the conventional RH. Overall, this work presents a promising approach to designing structures with enhanced energy absorption performance by combining multiple structural configurations and design methods.

# 1. Introduction

Metamaterials are a new type of man-made periodic materials with unique properties different from natural materials, including negative Poisson's ratio, negative stiffness, negative thermal expansion, and so on [1-4]. These properties can be regulated by altering their internal periodic structure [3,4]. Metamaterials can adapt to specialized and complex service environments and be applied to various cutting-edge fields [5,6]. Mechanical metamaterials with negative Poisson's ratio, known as auxetic metamaterials, can expand under tension and contract under compression, demonstrating a unique negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) effect [7-9]. Therefore, they have aroused widespread concern from researchers, and a lot of research has been done to promote their development, as shown in Fig. 1.

Traditional auxetic honeycombs have various types [10], including the re-entrant honeycomb (RH) [11], arrowhead honeycomb [12,13],

star-shaped honeycomb [14], chiral honeycomb [15,16], and rotating rigid honeycomb [17,18] (Fig. 1(a)). Among them, the RH can be regarded as the topological change of the regular hexagonal honeycomb, and the chiral honeycomb is ubiquitous in nature [15]. Due to their unique deformation properties, auxetic materials exhibit excellent energy absorption capacity, impact resistance, and indentation resistance, making them ideal for use in automobile components and explosion-proof structures to mitigate crushing and explosive loads [19-23] (Fig. 1(c)). In addition, owing to their exceptional mechanical properties, such as shear resistance, and their distinctive deformation characteristics, auxetic materials can also be applied in aerospace components (e.g., wings and antennas) [24-26], intravascular medical stents [27-29], and other fields [30-33].

With advancements in aerospace, navigation, transportation, and smart wear technology, pursuing auxetic honeycombs with enhanced mechanical performance, including energy absorption capacity and

elastic performance, has never ceased [34,35]. Meanwhile, with the advancement of additive manufacturing technology, the fabrication of auxetic metamaterials with complex configurations and excellent performance has become feasible, leading to the popularity and application of auxetic metamaterials [36]. Additional/curved reinforced strut [37-41], composite material [42], foam-filler [43], and sandwich core [44] are some important design methods, as shown in Fig. 1 (b3-b7). Some researchers also combined the auxetic metamaterials with the design methods of origami, kirigami, and compression-torsion metamaterials to obtain more structures with novel configurations and

deformation modes [45-48]. For instance, Zou et al. [37] introduced arched ligaments into the RH to form a novel auxetic structure with better energy absorption capacity and stable deformation mode. To reduce the possibility of manufacturing damage and stress concentration, Yang et al. [41] changed some straight arms of the double-headed honeycomb into curved walls and studied the mechanical properties of the improved structure through experiments, theories, and simulations. Quan et al. [42] fabricated continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite RH by 3D printing technology and systematically studied its in-plane mechanical behavior.

single material, this composite structure has excellent compressive stiffness and energy absorption ability. Luo et al. [43] introduced foam material into the traditional RH to improve energy absorption and load-bearing performance. To enhance the bending performance of the novel star-tringle honeycomb, Zhao et al. [44] utilized it as a core to form a sandwich structure. The result shows that due to the advantage of

the performance of star-triangle honeycomb, the newly formed sandwich structure presents better bending performance and lower initial peak stress. Ma et al. [45] proposed a re-entrant origami metamaterial and introduced gradient design into it. Through analysis and comparison, it's found that this structure presents better energy absorption capacity, and the initial peak stress can be regulated by adjusting the gradient

setting.

On the other hand, through continuous evolution, organisms in nature often possess intelligent and ingenious structures that inspire the development of metamaterials. Hierarchy [49-52] and hybrid [53-57] are some related design methods, which contain human wisdom and bionics (Fig. 1 (b1-b2)). These methods mainly use the mutual coupling between the different substructures to overcome the limitations of the original single structures. Tan et al. [49] proposed two hierarchical honeycombs by replacing the cell walls of the RH with the hexagonal substructure and triangle substructure. Through comparison, the specific energy absorption of the two honeycombs increases by  $292\%$  and  $105\%$ . Wang et al. [53] proposed a novel star-arrowhead honeycomb with multi-plateau stages by integrating the arrowhead honeycomb into the star-shaped honeycomb. They studied the in-plane elastic performance and energy absorption capacity using both numerical and theoretical methods. The results indicate that the absorbed energy of this structure is  $21.11\%$  higher than that of the traditional star-shaped honeycomb. The above progress shows that due to the great potential of auxetic honeycombs, it is expected to be designed to continuously achieve breakthroughs in performance. Additionally, when auxetic honeycombs are appropriately combined with other structures exhibiting different stiffness and deformation mechanisms, they can exhibit multi-plateau stages and reduced initial peak stress [53,56].

Currently, many novel auxetic honeycombs are primarily proposed by combining one or two configurations of traditional structures and employing a single design method. The deformation modes of such structures may often be difficult to control, and their properties are poor and unpredictable. Furthermore, there is limited research on the design of the novel auxetic honeycomb that integrates a broader range of traditional structural configurations and design methods. These advanced auxetic honeycombs, which exhibit superior performance, typically require the precise combination of various substructures/parts to achieve excellent coupling deformation, resulting in more stable deformation modes, additional plateau stages, predictable performance, and enhanced energy absorption capacity. However, as more substructures are introduced, the interaction mechanism between them becomes increasingly complex, and controlling the coupling effect becomes more challenging. This often leads to chaotic, disorderly, and uncontrollable deformation. Moreover, many of these structures are characterized by only a single plateau stage and concentrated energy absorption, which may damage their protective performance. At present, integrating a wider variety of traditional structural configurations and design methods to create novel structures remains a rare and challenging task. The complex interaction mechanism between multiple traditional structures needs to be further explored.

As a means of transportation, vehicles are characterized by high speed and large passenger capacity. Once a traffic accident happens, it may cause serious casualties [58-62]. Due to the unique NPR effect, auxetic honeycombs possess impressive energy absorption capabilities.

They can undergo the necessary deformation process within a confined space without expanding, thus preventing damage to surrounding components from compression. This makes them ideal for vehicles and other devices that require compact design of energy absorbers. For example, as shown in Fig. 2, impact protection utilizing auxetic metamaterials can be designed for railway vehicles to significantly reduce the risk of casualties.

In this work, based on hierarchical and hybrid design methods, a novel bio-inspired locally enhanced re-entrant honeycomb (LERH) is

proposed by combining three kinds of structures. Due to the great coupling deformation of substructures, it presents two plateau stages and superior energy absorption capacity. Based on experimental, numerical, and theoretical methods, the complex interaction mechanism of substructures and the energy absorption mechanism are clarified. Section 2 introduces models and methods, including the structural design strategy, evaluation indicators, numerical model, and material parameters. Section 3 clarifies the complex interaction mechanism of multiple substructures and the energy absorption mechanism. In addition,

their multifunctional requirements. Parallelogram and triangular veins widely exist in leaves, such as Victoria cruziana, maple, and lotus leaves, as shown in Fig. 3. Their main function is to transport nutrients and improve the load-bearing capacity and stability of the leaves [63,64]. In harsh and complex environments, such as strong winds and heavy rain, the leaves primarily undergo large deformations and rarely experience damage, fracture, or plastic deformation [65]. Furthermore, parallelogram and triangular structures have been widely used in engineering to prevent the instability of engineering structures such as bridges. Inspired by these structures, a novel locally enhanced re-entrant honeycomb (LERH) metamaterial is proposed by incorporating parallelogram and

triangular structures into the traditional re-entrant honeycomb (RH) using hierarchical and hybrid methods.

The structural parameters of the traditional RH include horizontal cell wall length  $L_{1}$ , inclined cell wall length  $L$ , included angle  $\theta$ , and cell wall thickness  $t$ . Similarly, the structural parameters of the LERH contain horizontal length  $L_{1}$ , inclined cell wall length  $L$ , included angle  $\theta$ , cell wall thickness  $t$ , and cell wall length of the parallelogram structure  $L / 2$ .

Relative density is a dimensionless quantity calculated as the ratio of the structure's density to that of the material [66]. It is an important characteristic of cellular structures and can be used to characterize the structural lightweight nature [67]. The relative density equation for the

RH is shown in Eq. (1). Different from the RH, the configuration of the LERH is more complex. Based on the geometrical relationship of the LERH, its relative density can be calculated using Eq. (2). The effect of  $\theta$  and  $L$  on the relative density of the LERH can be demonstrated in Fig. 4. It's found that within a certain range, the relative density increases with the decrease of  $\theta$  and  $L$ , and the influence of  $\theta$  on relative density is less significant than  $L$ .

\bar {\rho} _ {R H} = \frac {(2 L + L _ {1}) t}{2 L \sin \theta (L _ {1} - L \cos \theta)} \tag {1}

# 2.2. Evaluation indicators

To quantify structural performance and establish a solid foundation for the subsequent analysis, appropriate evaluation indicators are introduced. The stress and strain mentioned in this paper are nominal values, which are used to represent the equivalent state of the whole structure, rather than the state of the local position [8]. The stress  $(\sigma)$  can be expressed as the contact force between the honeycomb and the crushing plate divided by the initial cross-sectional area of the

honeycomb before deformation. The strain  $(\varepsilon)$  is expressed as the displacement of the honeycomb in the compression direction of the crushing plate divided by the initial height of the honeycomb before deformation.

As one of the most important indicators, plateau stress  $(\bar{\sigma})$  is the average stress of the plateau stage and can be calculated as [50]

$$
\bar {\sigma} = \frac {1}{\varepsilon_ {d} - \varepsilon_ {c r}} \int_ {\varepsilon_ {c r}} ^ {\varepsilon_ {d}} \sigma (\varepsilon) d \varepsilon \tag {3}
$$

where  $\varepsilon_{cr}$  is the strain corresponding to the first peak stress, and  $\varepsilon_{d}$  is the densified strain, which can be expressed as

$$
\left. \frac {d \mathrm {E A E} (\varepsilon)}{d \varepsilon} \right| _ {\varepsilon = \varepsilon_ {d}} = 0 \tag {4}
$$

where EAE is the energy absorption efficiency of the honeycomb and can be defined as

$$
\mathrm {E A E} = \frac {\int_ {0} ^ {\varepsilon} \sigma (\varepsilon) d \varepsilon}{\sigma (\varepsilon)} \tag {5}
$$

Specific energy absorption (SEA) is a key indicator for measuring crashworthiness and lightweight. It can be defined as the energy absorbed per unit of mass and can be calculated as

# 2.3. FE model

LS-DYNA, which is integrated into ANSYS/WORKBENCH 2021R1, is used to establish the finite element (FE) model. In this paper, considering economic cost and the needs of subsequent content arrangement, the two finite element (FE) models are modeled for the research. The first FE model has the same material and structural parameters as the experimental sample made by polyamide (PA) to validate the accuracy of the simulation. The second FE model made of aluminum alloy is used for the research in the following sections. Besides the structural and material parameters, other settings of these two models are the same. Due to the great mechanical properties and insensitivity to loading rate, Al (AA6060 T4) with Young's modulus  $E = 68.2 \mathrm{GPa}$ , Poisson's ratio  $\mu_0 = 0.3$ , density  $\rho_0 = 2700 \mathrm{kg / m^3}$  and yield strength  $\sigma_{\mathrm{ys}} = 80 \mathrm{MPa}$  is used as elastic-perfectly plastic and rate-independent material for the second FE model [68].

The set-up of the FE model is shown in Fig. 5, and the honeycomb is placed between two rigid plates. The upper plate compresses the honeycomb along the Y direction with a certain velocity  $(\nu)$ , and the bottom plate remains fixed. The range of compression velocity is set from  $1\mathrm{m / s}$

to  $140\mathrm{m / s}$ . To improve calculation efficiency, a surface model is applied and meshed using shell elements. An automatic surface-to-surface contact is adopted for the contact between the honeycomb and rigid plates. The static and dynamic friction coefficients between the honeycomb and two plates are taken to be 0.2 and 0.15, respectively [68]. In addition, the automatic single-surface contact is used to define the cell walls and five integration points along the thickness direction are adopted in the simulations to ensure convergence.

The positions of dots marked in red on the left and right sides of the honeycomb are denoted as  $c_{i}$  and  $d_{i}$ , respectively, and are used to track the horizontal position during the compression process (Fig. 5). The initial horizontal distance between  $c_{i}$  and  $d_{i}$  is  $d_{0}$ . During the compression process, the average displacement of these points in the X direction  $(\Delta L)$  can be calculated as  $\Delta L = d_{0} - \sum_{i=1}^{3} (c_{i} - d_{i}) / 3$ . The strain in the horizontal direction  $(\varepsilon_{x})$  can be calculated as  $\varepsilon_{x} = \Delta L / d_{0}$ . Similarly, the heights of the honeycomb before and after deformation are  $h_{0}$  and  $h_{1}$ , respectively. The strain in the vertical direction  $(\varepsilon_{y})$  can be calculated as  $\varepsilon_{y} = (h_{0} - h_{1}) / h_{0}$ . Hence, Poisson's ratio  $(\mu)$  can be obtained as  $\mu = -\varepsilon_{x} / \varepsilon_{y}$ .

# 2.4. Material parameters

Due to the great plasticity, polyamide (PA) is chosen as the base material to fabricate the 3D-printed dog-bone-shaped and honeycomb samples. To obtain the material property, the dog-bone-shaped samples are tested by tensile experiment on a universal experimenting machine (ETM504C, Shenzhen Wance Testing Machine Co., LTD.) with  $50\mathrm{kN}$  load cell. The parameters of dog-bone-shaped samples are shown in Fig. 6, and based on the ASTM D638 standard, the tensile velocity is set as  $2\mathrm{mm / min}$  [68]. The printing direction of dog-bone-shaped samples is consistent with that of the LERH samples. The engineering stress  $(\sigma_{e})$  and engineering strain  $(\varepsilon_{e})$  can be obtained directly from the tensile experiment. The true stress  $(\sigma_{t})$  and true strain  $(\varepsilon_{t})$  can be calculated as follows, and material parameters can be obtained (Table 1).

$$
\sigma_ {t} = \sigma_ {e} \left(1 + \varepsilon_ {e}\right) \tag {7}
$$

$$
\varepsilon_ {t} = \ln \left(1 + \varepsilon_ {e}\right) \tag {8}
$$

# 3. Results and discussions

# 3.1. FE model verification and deformation mechanism analysis

The structural parameters of the honeycomb samples and settings of the quasi-static compression experiment are illustrated in Figs. 7-8.

Among them, as mentioned in Fig. 3, the RH-2 is constructed by embedding parallelogram structures in the RH. The samples of the LERH, RH, and RH-2 have the same structural parameters, and their outplane thickness  $(b)$  is set to  $18\mathrm{mm}$  to ensure the in-plane deformation. The quasi-static compression experiment is carried out on the universal experimenting machine (ETM504C, Shenzhen Wance Testing Machine Co., LTD.) with  $50\mathrm{kN}$  load cell. The bottom plate is fixed, and the top plate compresses structures with a velocity of  $2\mathrm{mm / min}$  [16,69]. The experimental data is obtained by a data acquisition system, and the deformation mode is photographed by a camera.

On the premise of keeping the kinetic energy below  $10\%$  of the internal energy, the efficiency of the numerical analysis of quasi-static compression is improved by setting the compression velocity in the numerical model to  $1\mathrm{m / s}$  [70]. Aiming to determine the appropriate mesh size, convergence analysis is carried out, as shown in Fig. 9. When the mesh size is lower than  $1.25\mathrm{mm}$ , plateau stress tends to converge gradually, and the calculation time is relatively larger. Therefore, the shell element with a mesh size of  $1\mathrm{mm}$  is used to balance the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation. The number of nodes and units of the LERH are 28,956 and 29,700, respectively.

The experimental and numerical results of the stress-strain curves and Poisson's ratio-strain curves of the LERH, RH-2, and RH are shown in Fig. 10. As expected, different from the RH, the LERH has five deformation stages, including the elastic stage  $(0 < \varepsilon < \varepsilon_{cr})$ , first plateau stage  $(\varepsilon_{cr} < \varepsilon < \varepsilon_{1})$ , transitional stage  $(\varepsilon_{1} < \varepsilon < \varepsilon_{2})$ , second plateau stage  $(\varepsilon_{2} < \varepsilon < \varepsilon_{d})$ , and densified stage  $(\varepsilon > \varepsilon_{d})$ , where  $\varepsilon_{1}$  is the end of the first plateau stage, and  $\varepsilon_{2}$  is the beginning of the second plateau stage. The first plateau stress  $(\overline{\sigma}_{1})$  is the mean value of stress when strain is between  $\varepsilon_{cr}$  and  $\varepsilon_{1}$ . The second plateau stress  $(\overline{\sigma}_{2})$  is the mean value of stress when strain is between  $\varepsilon_{2}$  and  $\varepsilon_{d}$ .

Fig. 11 shows the deformation modes of the LERH, RH-2, and RH. Due to the symmetry of structural deformation, a quarter of the LERH can be used for the analysis of the local deformation mode (Fig. 11(b)). During the compression, the LEHR mainly undergoes bending/buckling

deformation of ligaments. In the first plateau stage, the deformation mainly focuses on the bending deformation of ligaments AC and BD ((1) of Fig. 11(b)). At this time, the Poisson's ratio is close to zero (Fig. 10 (b)). When strain increases to 0.33, it enters the transitional stage. The ligaments AC and BD contact with ligaments EC and CD, respectively. With the further increase of strain, the coupling deformation of the other internal substructure begins equally, and the second plateau stage forms  $(\varepsilon > 0.4)$ . The ligaments EH and CI have similar deformation modes as ligaments AC and BD. Meanwhile, the ligament DI also deforms ((2) of Fig. 11(b)). After that, ligaments BD (CD) and DF start to bend ((3) of Fig. 11(b)). Since more plastic hinges are formed, the second plateau stress  $(\bar{\sigma}_{2})$  is  $242.59\%$  larger than that of the first plateau stress  $(\bar{\sigma}_{1})$ , which is helpful to dissipate energy gradually. During the transitional and the second plateau stages, the Poisson's ratio decreases obviously with the increase of strain, and deformation presents negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) mode, which is also known as 'hourglass mode' reported in other research [16]. Finally, the LERH enters the densified stage. During this stage, the value of stress and Poisson's ratio increases.

During the compression process, the deformation mechanism of the RH-2 is the coupling deformation between the nested parallelogram structure and the RH (Fig. 11(c)). The negative Poisson's ratio effect of the RH-2 is obvious, and the minimum value of Poisson's ratio is  $-0.72$ . However, due to the boundary effect, part of the parallelogram substructures of the RH-2 are squeezed out and cannot deform sufficiently.

As for the traditional RH, the deformation mainly focuses on the bending of inclined cell walls (Fig. 11(d)). However, when strain reaches 0.3, the RH presents the buckling deformation mode, and the part of the RH is squeezed out, resulting in its small plateau stress  $(\bar{\sigma}_{3})$  and lower energy absorption capacity.

Additionally, the error between numerical and experimental results of plateau stress and SEA is shown in Table 2, and the error is lower than  $5\%$ . The slight discrepancy can be attributed to manufacturing defects. Overall, the experimental results are in good agreement with the simulation results. The finite element model can be considered accurate

# 3.2. Dynamic crushing responses

In this section, the effect of crushing velocity on the dynamic crushing response of the LERH is investigated, as shown in Figs. 12-16 ( $t = 1\mathrm{mm}$ ,  $\theta = 60^{\circ}$ ,  $L = 10\mathrm{mm}$ ,  $b = 1\mathrm{mm}$ , and  $L_{1} = 20\mathrm{mm}$ ). According to

the change of deformation modes under different crushing velocities, it's found the LERH presents low-velocity mode (L-mode), medium-velocity mode (M-mode), and high-velocity mode (H-mode), respectively (Fig. 12). Therefore, the relevant crushing velocity can be divided into low-velocity  $(\nu \leq 20\mathrm{m / s})$ , medium-velocity  $(20\mathrm{m / s}\leq \nu < 80\mathrm{m / s})$  and high-velocity crushing  $(\nu \geq 80\mathrm{m / s})$ . With the increase of crushing velocity, the stress-strain curves fluctuate more obviously, and the

plateau stress, SEA, and EA become larger (Fig. 13). The effect of crushing velocity on EAE is shown in Fig. 14. As the crushing velocity increases, the EAE-strain curves oscillate more violently, and the overall value of EAE increases. One reason for this phenomenon is that with the increase of crushing velocity, the oscillation of stress-strain curves becomes more obvious during compression. Particularly at medium and high-velocity crushing, when the strain reaches a certain value, the stress can be very small, resulting in a large EAE. Additionally, under medium and high-velocity crushing, the absorbed energy during the compression process is significantly higher, leading to an overall increase in EAE.

Under low-velocity crushing, the deformation mode is similar to that discussed in Section 3.1. The deformation in the first plateau stage is mainly concentrated on the inclined cell wall of the parallelogram structure nested in the LERH. At this time, the deformation mode is uniform (Fig. 12). After entering the second plateau stage, due to the

NPR effect, some central units are greatly squeezed by surrounding units and enter the next deformation mode earlier than other units. At this time, the LERH presents the obvious NPR effect. The deformation and collapse gradually spread from the central units to other units, so that the stress fluctuates up and down in a certain range, thus forming the second plateau stress.

Under medium-velocity crushing, during the first plateau stage, the parallelogram structure has a similar deformation mode as that under low-velocity crushing. However, the overall deformation sequence of periodic units in the LERH changes, and the LERH deforms from the top crushing end to the fixed end. After entering the second deformation stage, the propagation of deformation occurs from unit cells near the fixed end to those near the top crushing end, which is different from the l-mode. Meanwhile, the NPR effect is less obvious than that under low-velocity crushing, and the Poisson's ratio is higher (Fig. 15). When the crushing velocity increases to  $70\mathrm{m / s}$ , due to the further influence of the

inertia effect, units near the crushing end deform early. Additionally, the LERH undergoes the deformation of the first and second plateau stages described above at the same time, showing 'hybrid' deformation. However, units near the fixed end almost don't have deformation. At

this time, the NPR effect is unobvious.

Under high-velocity crushing, the influence of the inertia effect is more significant, causing the complete disappearance of the NPR effect and two plateau stages phenomenon. At this time, the LERH directly

collapses from unit cells near the top crushing end to those near the fixed end in a layer-by-layer mode, and Poisson's ratio is close to zero.

The effect of crushing velocity on energy-strain curves of the LERH is shown in Fig. 16. Under the low-velocity crushing  $(\nu = 1\mathrm{m / s})$ , the ratio of kinetic energy to internal energy is very small, and almost all the crushing energy is converted into the internal energy, which is the reason why this crushing velocity can also be regarded as low-velocity crushing [55]. With the increase of crushing velocity, the proportion of kinetic energy to total energy gradually increases.

# 3.3. Theoretical analysis of plateau stress

Based on Section 3.2, the theoretical models of plateau stress under different crushing velocities are deduced in this part. This helps to clarify in depth the quantitative effect of geometric parameters and crushing velocity on plateau stress, thus further revealing the energy dissipation mechanism.

# 3.3.1. Low-velocity crushing

Reasonable assumption is important for simplifying and solving nonlinear problems. According to the low-velocity mode discussed in Section 3.2, it is assumed that the cell wall length remains unchanged during deformation. Additionally, due to the large number of periodic units in the LERH, the global deformation can be regarded as the same. According to the periodicity of the LERH, a typical unit cell in Fig. 12 is selected for theoretical analysis of the first and second plateau stress, as shown in Fig. 17 ( $\nu = 1 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ ).

According to the theory of energy conservation, the work done by the external crushing force  $(E)$  can be converted into kinetic energy generated by cell walls  $(E_{k})$  and energy generated by plastic hinges  $(E_{p})$ .

$$
E = E _ {k} + E _ {p} \tag {9}
$$

During the first plateau stage, the location of plastic hinges in the parallelogram substructures is partly marked in red circles (Fig. 17). The changed degree of each plastic hinge is  $\theta$ , and the plastic dissipation of the sixteen hinges  $(E_{p1})$  can be calculated as

$$
E _ {p 1} = 1 6 M _ {1} \theta \tag {10}
$$

where  $M_{1}$  is the fully plastic bending moment of the inclined cell wall with the thickness of  $t$  and can be calculated as  $M_{1} = \sigma_{\mathrm{ys}}bt^{2} / 4$ .

Kinetic energy can be expressed as [14]

$$
E _ {k} = \frac {1}{2} \mathrm {m} _ {L E R H} v _ {1} ^ {2} = 2 t b \rho_ {s} \bar {\rho} v _ {1} ^ {2} L \sin \theta \left(L _ {1} - L \cos \theta\right) \tag {11}
$$

where  $\overline{\rho},\rho_s$  , and  $\nu_{1}$  are relative density, the density of base material, and crushing velocity, respectively.  $m_{LERH}$  represents the mass of the LERH.

The work done by the external crushing force in the first plateau stage  $(E_{1})$  is

$$
E _ {1} = \bar {\sigma} _ {L 1} S \Delta H = \bar {\sigma} _ {L 1} L _ {0} b (L \sin \theta - 4 t) \tag {12}
$$

where  $S = L_0b$ ,  $\Delta H = L\sin \theta - 4t$ , and  $L_0$  represent the section area, compression displacement, and initial width of the unit cell, respectively.  $\overline{\sigma}_{L1}$  is the first plateau stress.  $L_0$  can be calculated as

![](file://D:/MinerU/转换结果/156.pdf-df994d06-a848-4722-a4f2-8af34b8250a4/images/c5e6b1d439fa9136c859a3a6f1dd2e92fce517ec95d99e1bfa2f024de0d7f092.jpg)

(d) Initial peak stress



Fig. 26. Comparison of the crushing responses of the LERH and other structures  $(\nu = 1\mathrm{m / s})$


$$
L _ {0} = 2 L _ {1} - 2 L \cos \theta \tag {13}
$$

Therefore, combining Eqs. (10-13) into Eq. (9), the first plateau stress can be derived as

$$
\bar {\sigma} _ {L 1} = \frac {2 \theta \sigma_ {y s} t ^ {2} + L \sin \theta (L _ {1} - L \cos \theta) \rho_ {s} \bar {\rho} \mathrm {t v} _ {1} ^ {2}}{(L _ {1} - L \cos \theta) (L \sin \theta - 4 t)} \tag {14}
$$

As for the second plateau stage, plastic hinges occur in multiple kinds of locations. Firstly, the location of the plastic hinges of the parallelogram substructures is partly indicated by orange circles in Fig. 17. The energy dissipated by the plastic hinges of the parallelogram substructures  $(E_{p2})$  can be calculated as

$$
E _ {p _ {2}} = 1 6 M _ {1} \theta \tag {15}
$$

Secondly, the location of the plastic hinges of the horizontal cell walls is partly marked in purple circles in Fig. 17. The energy dissipated by the plastic hinges of horizontal cell walls  $(E_{\mathrm{p3}})$  can be obtained as

$$
E _ {p 3} = 4 M _ {1} \alpha + 2 M _ {2} \alpha \tag {16}
$$

where  $M_2$  is the plastic bending moment of the deformed cell wall with the thickness of  $2t$  and can be calculated as  $M_2 = \sigma_{ys}bt^2$ .  $\alpha / 2$  is approximately equal to the rotation angle of plastic hinges. According to the geometric relationship,  $\alpha$  can be obtained as

$$
\alpha = \frac {L _ {1} - L - L \cos \theta}{3 t} \tag {17}
$$

Thirdly, the location of the plastic hinges of the inclined cell walls is partly marked in black circles in Fig. 17. The energy dissipated by inclined cell walls  $(E_{p4})$  can be expressed as

$$
E _ {p _ {4}} = 4 \left(\alpha_ {1} + \alpha_ {2} + \pi\right) M _ {1} \tag {18}
$$

where  $\alpha_{1}$  and  $\alpha_{2}$  are approximately equal to the rotation angles of plastic hinges  $(\alpha_{1} + \alpha_{2} = \pi)$ .

Considering the complex deformation mechanism and inadequate deformation of the cell walls, the work done by the external crushing force in the second plateau stage  $(E_{2})$  can be calculated as

$$
E _ {2} = \bar {\sigma} _ {L 2} L _ {0} b (L \sin \theta - 4. 2 5 t) \tag {19}
$$

Therefore, combining Eqs. (11, 15-19) into Eq. (9), the second plateau stress can be derived as

$$
\bar {\sigma} _ {L 2} = \frac {(1 6 \theta + 1 2 \alpha + 8 \pi) \sigma_ {y s} t ^ {2} + 8 L \sin \theta (L _ {1} - L \cos \theta) \rho_ {s} \bar {\rho} \mathrm {t v} _ {1} ^ {2}}{8 (L _ {1} - L \cos \theta) (L \sin \theta - 4 . 2 5 t)} \tag {20}
$$

At the end of the first and second plateau stages, the corresponding strains are  $\varepsilon_{1}$  and  $\varepsilon_{d}$ , respectively, and can be obtained as

$$
\varepsilon_ {1} = \frac {L \sin \theta - 4 t}{2 L \sin \theta} \tag {21}
$$

$$
\varepsilon_ {d} = \frac {2 L \sin \theta - 8 . 2 5 t}{2 L \sin \theta} \tag {22}
$$

Therefore, the average plateau stress  $(\bar{\sigma}_{L0})$  can be calculated as

$$
\bar {\sigma} _ {L 0} = \beta \bar {\sigma} _ {L 1} + (1 - \beta) \bar {\sigma} _ {L 2} \tag {23}
$$

where  $\beta$  is a coefficient and can be obtained as

$$
\beta = \frac {\varepsilon_ {1}}{\varepsilon_ {d}} = \frac {L \sin \theta - 4 t}{2 L \sin \theta - 8 . 2 5 t} \tag {24}
$$

To verify the accuracy of the theoretical model, the plateau stress obtained by the theoretical and numerical methods is compared with each other, as shown in Table 3. The absolute value of the error is  $< 10\%$ . Therefore, the calculation model can be considered reliable.

# 3.3.2. Medium and high-velocity crushing

As mentioned in Section 3.2, the deformation modes under medium and high-velocity crushing are quite different from those under low-velocity crushing. Under medium and high-velocity crushing, according to one-dimensional shock theory, the expression of average dynamic plateau stress  $(\overline{\sigma}_{H0})$  of honeycombs can be calculated as [71]

$$
\bar {\sigma} _ {H 0} = \bar {\sigma} _ {L 0} + A v ^ {2} \tag {25}
$$

where  $A$  is related to the relative density of the honeycomb and can be obtained as

$$
A = b _ {1} \bar {\rho} ^ {2} + b _ {2} \bar {\rho} + b _ {3} \tag {26}
$$

where  $b_{1}, b_{2}$ , and  $b_{3}$  are coefficients.

According to the fitting results of the LERH in Fig. 18,  $b_{1}$ ,  $b_{2}$ , and  $b_{3}$  can be obtained as 0.003319, 0.002407, and 0.00001516, respectively. Thus,  $\bar{\sigma}_{H}$  can be expressed as

$$
\bar {\sigma} _ {H 0} = \beta \bar {\sigma} _ {L 1} + (1 - \beta) \bar {\sigma} _ {L 2} + \left(0. 0 0 3 3 1 9 \bar {\rho} ^ {2} + 0. 0 0 2 4 0 7 \bar {\rho} + 1. 5 1 6 E - 5\right) v ^ {2} \tag {27}
$$

It needs to be further clarified that Eq. (27) is a semi-empirical expression derived through least squares fitting based on the specific data in our study, which provides the necessary support for predicting the dynamic crushing response of the structure. While it provides a good approximation for the cases studied, the more general formula needs to be further established and verified in the future.

Table 4 compares the plateau stress obtained by Eq. (27) and numerical results under medium and high-velocity crushing. The value of error is acceptable, and the theoretical model can be considered reliable.

# 3.4. Effect of cell number on crushing responses

The influence of the cell number in the X direction  $(N_{x})$  and Y direction  $(N_{y})$  on crushing response is studied in this part, as shown in Figs. 19-21. When  $N_{x}$  and  $N_{y}$  are small, the number of units affected by the boundary effect accounts for a large proportion of all units in the LERH, which tends to cause an unstable crushing response. For example, when  $N_{y} = 6$  and  $N_{x} = 1$ , the deformation mode is unstable and presents the 'S' shaped mode, which is unfavorable for the LERH to absorb energy, causing the decrease of second plateau stress (Figs. 19-20). As  $N_{x}$  increases, the deformation mode of the LERH becomes stable, and stress-strain curves and EAE-strain curves show similar variation tendencies. When  $N_{x} \geq 4$ , SEA tends to be more stable (Fig. 21(a)). The reason for this is that with the increase of  $N_{x}$ , the LERH is less affected by the boundary effect, and the stress distribution is more consistent throughout the structure. Similarly, when  $N_{x} = N_{y}$ , the change of cell number has little influence on the deformation modes and variation tendency of stress-strain curves and EAE-strain curves. When  $N_{x} = N_{y} \geq 4$ , SEA tends to be more stable (Fig. 21(b)). Therefore, aiming to avoid the influence of the boundary effect on analysis results,  $N_{x} = N_{y} = 6$  is set for the

following parametric analysis.

# 3.5. Effect of structural parameters on crushing responses

The effect of structural parameters on stress-strain curves, plateau stress, and SEA-strain curves is studied, as illustrated in Fig. 22. The theoretical predictions calculated by Eqs. (14), (20) and (23) are also included for comparison, presenting good agreement between the theoretical and numerical results. It can be found that the plateau stress increases with the decrease of  $L$  and  $\theta$ , and with the increase of  $t$ . In addition,  $t$  and  $L$  have a more significant effect compared to  $\theta$ . To study these relationships more deeply, Fig. 23, which integrates Eqs (14) and (20), illustrates the comprehensive effects of  $\theta$ ,  $t$ , and  $L$  on both the first and second plateau stress. This figure offers a practical tool, which can directly determine the appropriate structural parameters according to a specified plateau stress target. Due to the comprehensive effect of densified strain, plateau stress, and mass of the LERH, the SEA increases with the increase of  $t$  and  $\theta$ , and with the decrease of  $L$ .

The deformation modes of the LERH with different structural parameters are shown in Fig. 24. The change of structural parameters has little effect on the deformation modes and only alters the strain transitioning to the next deformation stage. This is due to the change in the space for deformation induced by the change of the relative density of the LERH.

# 3.6. Crashworthiness comparison with other structures

To verify the excellent energy absorption capacity of the LERH, the crashworthiness is compared with other auxetic honeycombs, as shown in Figs. 25-26. To ensure the fairness of the comparison, the numerical models of these honeycombs are constructed using the same material and boundary conditions listed in Section 2.3, and their relative density is set as 0.3464. The detailed structural parameters and deformation modes of different structures are shown in the Supplementary Material.

As illustrated in Fig. 25(a) and (c), the average plateau stress of the LERH is  $118.4\%$  and  $66.7\%$  larger than that of the RH and RH-2, and the SEA of the LERH is  $155.3\%$  and  $49.2\%$  larger than that of the RH and RH-2, respectively. This advantage is mainly due to the higher second plateau stress of the STCH, which is attributed to the presence of more plastic hinges in the second plateau stage as well as good coupling relations between the substructures. The global Poisson's ratio of the LERH is higher than that of the RH and RH-2 (Fig. 25(d)).

Additionally, compared to the novel star-arrowhead honeycomb (SAH) [53], re-entrant star-shaped honeycomb (RSH) [56], star-circle honeycomb (SCH) [68], concentric auxetic re-entrant honeycomb (CARH) [50], and re-entrant circular (REC) auxetic honeycomb [39], the LERH also presents higher plateau stress and SEA (Fig. 26(a)-(b)). Specifically, the SEA and plateau stress of the LERH are  $52\%$  and  $70\%$  larger than that of the SAH, respectively. The minimum value of Poisson's ratio of the LERH is  $-0.22$ , which is higher than that of the CARH, REC, and RSH (Fig. 26(c)). This value is similar to the minimum value of Poisson's ratio of the SCH and SAH. Additionally, compared to other structures, the initial peak force of the LERH is relatively lower (Fig. 26 (d)). Therefore, the LERH can efficiently dissipate energy while keeping the initial peak stress relatively low. The better crashworthiness of the LERH can be attributed to the presence of two plateau stages, a greater number of plastic hinges, and stable deformation modes, which arise from the synergistic effect of the nested RH, triangular, and parallelogram structures.

# 4. Conclusions

Inspired by bionics, a novel auxetic structure (LERH) with excellent energy absorption and stable deformation mode is proposed by introducing parallelogram and triangle configurations into the traditional RH. The energy absorption characteristics are comprehensively

analyzed in experimental, numerical, and theoretical methods. The main conclusions are as follows.



(1) Based on the quasi-static compression experiment, the energy dissipation mechanism of the LERH is analyzed, and the accuracy of the numerical model is verified. The LERH has two plateau stages. Due to the formation of more plastic hinges, the second plateau stress is  $242.59\%$  larger than the first plateau stress, which helps to gradually absorb and buffer impact energy.





(2) Under low, medium, and high-velocity crushing, the LERH has three different deformation modes. With the increase of crushing velocity, the plateau stress and SEA are higher, and the inertia effect is more obvious, causing more violent fluctuation of stress-strain curves. Under high-velocity crushing, the units near the impact end tend to collapse earlier, leading to the disappearance of the NPR effect and two plateau stages phenomenon.





(3) To explain the energy dissipation mechanism deeply, based on the deformation mode and energy conservation theory, theoretical models are derived to predict plateau stress under low-velocity crushing. In addition, based on one-dimensional shock theory, the theoretical formula of dynamic plateau stress under medium and high-velocity crushing is obtained.





(4) According to parametric analysis, it's found that the SEA increases with the increase of  $t$  and  $\theta$ , and with the decrease of  $L$ . Due to the high deformation stability of the LERH, when structural parameters change, it exhibits a similar deformation mode, with only the strain transitioning to the next deformation stage altered.





(5) Due to the great coupling effect of different substructures, compared to other auxetic honeycombs, the LERH shows stronger energy absorption performance, and its SEA is  $155.3\%$  higher than that of the RH.



In summary, this study investigates the energy absorption performance of a novel auxetic honeycomb with perfect coupling deformation between its substructures and clarifies the complex interaction mechanisms among them. This work provides a more comprehensive approach to the design of auxetic honeycombs by integrating a broader range of traditional structural configurations and design methods, thus facilitating the further development and application of auxetic metamaterials.
